# Project Rules

- **Git Push on Keymap Changes**: Whenever a keymap change is requested and implemented, the changes must be pushed to the remote repository (https://github.com/d1Uta/zmk-keyboard-toucan).
- **Verify File Content Before Edit**: Always run `view_file` or check the latest diff before applying `replace_file_content` to ensure TargetContent matches exactly.
